### Getting started with the docs

Install nodejs, it is recommended to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script):

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
# After this, you can use nvm to install the latest version of node:
nvm install node
```

If you are not using NVM, just install the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS

Once you have Node installed, switch to the `staging` branch of this repository and install package dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

Then you can start looking at the docs and editing them using:

```
npm run start
```
