# K8S Exporter

Our integration with Kubernetes allows you to export Kubernetes objects to Port as Entities of existing Blueprints.

## What does our Kubernetes Exporter offer you?

- List and export existing Kubernetes objects in your cluster.
- Watch for changes (Create/Update/Delete) of Kubernetes objects in real time and automatically apply the changes to your Entities in Port.
- Configure which Kubernetes objects are relevant, and how to map and transform objects to Port Entities.
