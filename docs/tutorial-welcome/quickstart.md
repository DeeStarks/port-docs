# Quickstart

Port helps you to -

1. Map all your software and infrastructure components (microservices, monoliths, deployments, repos, databases, and more) and see all of them in one place
2. Create a self-service portal for your internal customers in order to empower them to perform actions and reduce toil on the DevOps team, while ensuring unified standards and governance over the processes inside your organization
3. Create a **comprehensive catalog** by mapping all your software and infrastructure components (microservices, monoliths, deployments, repos, databases, and more) and see all of them in one place
4. Make your **catalog active** by assigning to it actions that can be used by you and your internal customers, while ensuring unified standards and governance over the processes inside your organization

In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Port to better understand what your software and infrastructure are made of, and manage all the components in one place.

## 1. Define Your Entity Types

Portâ€™s two main building blocks are entity types and entities.

In this section, we will define the entity types that our entities will be based on.

### Entity Types & Properties

Letâ€™s start by choosing the **entity types according to what we want to manage in Port.**

Please pick a relevant scenario, and perform the API call to create the entity types:

```jsx
Here we will have a list of scenarios (microservice management, environments..).
When the user chooses a scenario, a **diagram** will be displayed with the **API code**
and a copy button
```

### Relationship Definition

The next step after creating the entity types will be to **define the relationships between them.**

According to the scenario you have selected above, perform the relevant API call to create the relationships:

```jsx
Here we will have a list of scenarios (microservice management, environments..).
When the user chooses a scenario, a diagram will be displayed with the API code
and a copy button
```

:::note
ðŸ’¡ Got confused for some reason? you can delete all data and start again by using this API call - add here
:::


**Great! ðŸ¥³**Â  now we have a **model** that represents the entities that we want to manage in Port

**Click here to see the entity model inside your system**

## 2. Create Your First Entities

Now we will **create entities based on our entity types.**

According to the scenario you have selected above, perform the relevant API call to create some entities:

```jsx
Here we will have a list of scenarios (microservice management, environments..).
When the user chooses a scenario, a diagram will be displayed with the API code
and a copy button
```

## 3. View The Data You Created!

All done! ðŸŽŠÂ  you have created -

1. A **model (entity types and relationships)** that represents your organization
2. Entities based on this model

In addition, a **page for each entity** type is automatically created for you.

You can view it all in **your system**

:::tip
ðŸ’¡ You can create more pages that display information about your entities. For further information please see the [pages section](https://www.notion.so/Pages-8e026b983f2d40cb8f9b3c04b9b50c03)

### What Now?

1. **Create your own entities by integrating Port with your processes**
    1. This can be done by adding our API call to your workflow. For example - create a new environment in Port through a Terraform script. Check out the **[Templates Section](https://www.notion.so/Templates-6f16be20ed234ed5a77952e2494b7c26)** to get inspiration on what you could manage with Port and also start with one click!

2. **Turn your catalog to an active portal by assigning actions to your entities**
