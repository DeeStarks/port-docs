# Run on events

Our AWS integration allows you to trigger a sync of your AWS resources with Port, by certain events (in addition to the scheduled sync).
As a result, your software catalog will be updated shortly after a resource is created, updated or deleted.

## How it works

Many AWS services emit events to [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) service, to the accountâ€™s default event bus.

Furthermore, [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) service automatically emit events for API calls from most of the AWS services.

A user can create an [AWS EventBridge rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html) to consume and transform particular events, and send them to a target, such as an [AWS SQS Queue](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).

[The AWS exporter application](./aws.md#exporter-aws-serverless-application) creates an SQS Queue as part of the stack, and configure it as an event source of the exporter's Lambda.

What's left to do, is to set up an event rule, that consume any events from the bus and send them to the AWS exporter's queue.

Moreover, each event will have to be transformed as part of the event rule, before reaching the queue, to suit the exporter's Lambda needs.

The transformation goal is to map an event to a single AWS resource, that the exporter can handle.

The events in the queue are consumed automatically by the exporter's Lambda, that will sync the updated state of the relevant AWS resources with Port.

### Input structure for a single event

The AWS Exporter's Lambda accepts a JSON event, with the following properties, for syncing a single resource:

- `resource_type` - an hardcoded string representing the AWS resource type, that is configured in the [`config.json`](./aws.md#exporter-configjson-file) of the AWS Exporter.
- `region` - A JQ query to get the region from the event, usually the value will be `"\"<awsRegion>\""`
- `action` (Optional, defaults to `upsert`) - A JQ query to define the desired action: `upsert` or `delete` the Port entity of the resource. Will Usually be based on the event name, like in the example below.
- `identifier` - A JQ query to calculate the AWS Cloud Control API resource identifier (not the Port entity identifier).

An example for such a JSON event:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "requestFunctionName": "<requestFunctionName>",
  "responseFunctionName": "<responseFunctionName>",
  "eventName": "<eventName>",
  # highlight-start
  "resource_type": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
  "region": "\"<awsRegion>\"",
  "action": "if .eventName | startswith(\"Delete\") then \"delete\" else \"upsert\" end",
  "identifier": "if .responseFunctionName != \"\" then .responseFunctionName else .requestFunctionName end"
  # highlight-end
}
```

:::tip
To get the identifier formula of a specific resource type, like `AWS::Lambda::Function`, you can use the following command:

```bash showLineNumbers
aws cloudformation describe-type --type RESOURCE --type-name AWS::Lambda::Function --query "Schema" | jq 'fromjson | .primaryIdentifier | join("|")'

"/properties/FunctionName"
```

Here you can see that the identifier of a Lambda function is the function name.

Another example, for the `AWS::ECS::Service` resource type:

```bash showLineNumbers
aws cloudformation describe-type --type RESOURCE --type-name AWS::ECS::Service --query "Schema" | jq 'fromjson | .primaryIdentifier | join("|")'

"/properties/ServiceArn|/properties/Cluster"
```

Here you have two properties in the formula: `/properties/ServiceArn` and `/properties/Cluster`. When there are multiple properties, the values in the identifier are separated by `|`.

### Event rule

#### Definition

The event rule is how you specify the exact events you want to consume, and to which target you want to produce (including the transformation to the input).

Before diving deep into the [event rule properties](#event-rule-properties), here is a complete example of a `CloudFormation YAML template` to manage an event rule, for the AWS Exporter:

```yaml showLineNumbers
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: The template used to create event rules for the Port AWS Exporter.

Parameters:
  PortAWSExporterStackName:
    Description: Name of the Port AWS Exporter stack name
    Type: String
    MinLength: 1
    MaxLength: 255
    AllowedPattern: "^[a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*$"
    Default: serverlessrepo-port-aws-exporter

Resources:
  EventRule0:
    Type: AWS::Events::Rule
    Properties:
      EventBusName: default
      EventPattern:
        source:
          - aws.lambda
        detail-type:
          - AWS API Call via CloudTrail
        detail:
          eventSource:
            - lambda.amazonaws.com
          eventName:
            - prefix: UpdateFunctionConfiguration
            - prefix: CreateFunction
            - prefix: DeleteFunction
      Name: port-aws-exporter-sync-lambda-trails
      State: ENABLED
      Targets:
        - Id: "PortAWSExporterEventsQueue"
          Arn:
            {
              "Fn::ImportValue":
                { "Fn::Sub": "${PortAWSExporterStackName}-EventsQueueARN" },
            }
          InputTransformer:
            InputPathsMap:
              awsRegion: $.detail.awsRegion
              eventName: $.detail.eventName
              requestFunctionName: $.detail.requestParameters.functionName
              responseFunctionName: $.detail.responseElements.functionName
            InputTemplate: |-
              {
                "resource_type": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
                "requestFunctionName": "<requestFunctionName>",
                "responseFunctionName": "<responseFunctionName>",
                "eventName": "<eventName>",
                "region": "\"<awsRegion>\"",
                "identifier": "if .responseFunctionName != \"\" then .responseFunctionName else .requestFunctionName end",
                "action": "if .eventName | startswith(\"Delete\") then \"delete\" else \"upsert\" end"
              }
```

:::info
This example of CloudFormation stack can be used to act on changes of Lambda functions.
Moreover, it includes a parameter called `PortAWSExporterStackName`, that refers to the main exporter's stack name. That way, we can send the events to the existing exporter's events queue, for syncing relevant AWS resources.
:::

#### Properties

Let's review the properties of the event rule resource from above.

- The `EventBusName` property value is `default`, as this is the bus that gets events from various AWS services automatically:

```yaml showLineNumbers
Properties:
  # highlight-next-line
  EventBusName: default
  ...
```

- The `EventPattern` property defines which events to consume, including which event sources, and other filters based on the event structure.
  Here, we define the event pattern to consume Cloudtrail API calls, sourced from the Lambda service; On top of that, we filter only the `UpdateFunctionConfiguration`, `CreateFunction` and `DeleteFunction` events:

```yaml showLineNumbers
Properties:
  EventBusName: default
  # highlight-start
  EventPattern:
    source:
      - aws.lambda
    detail-type:
      - AWS API Call via CloudTrail
    detail:
      eventSource:
        - lambda.amazonaws.com
      eventName:
        - prefix: UpdateFunctionConfiguration
        - prefix: CreateFunction
        - prefix: DeleteFunction
  # highlight-end
```

:::

- The `Targets` property defines the targets of the produced events.
  In that case, we want to configure the AWS Exporter events queue as the target:

```yaml showLineNumbers
Properties:
  ...
  # highlight-start
  Targets:
    - Id: "PortAWSExporterEventsQueue"
      Arn: { "Fn::ImportValue" : {"Fn::Sub": "${PortAWSExporterStackName}-EventsQueueARN" } }
      ...
  # highlight-end
```

- The `InputTransformer` key in `Targets` property, defines the transformation applied to the event, before sending it to the target queue;

```yaml showLineNumbers
Properties:
  ...
  Targets:
    - Id: "PortAWSExporterEventsQueue"
      Arn: { "Fn::ImportValue" : {"Fn::Sub": "${PortAWSExporterStackName}-EventsQueueARN" } }
      # highlight-next-line
      InputTransformer:
        ...
```

- `InputPathsMap` key in `InputTransformer`, defines which fields to extract from the event. It makes use of [`JSONPath`](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html) syntax to configure the extraction:

```yaml showLineNumbers
Properties:
  ...
  Targets:
    - Id: "PortAWSExporterEventsQueue"
      Arn: { "Fn::ImportValue" : {"Fn::Sub": "${PortAWSExporterStackName}-EventsQueueARN" } }
      InputTransformer:
        # highlight-start
        InputPathsMap:
          awsRegion: $.detail.awsRegion
          eventName: $.detail.eventName
          requestFunctionName: $.detail.requestParameters.functionName
          responseFunctionName: $.detail.responseElements.functionName
        # highlight-end
        ...
```

For instance, the event received in EventBridge bus for the `CreateFunction` Lambda API call is something like:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  ...
  "detail": {
    ...
    "eventSource": "lambda.amazonaws.com",
    "eventName": "CreateFunction20150331",
    "awsRegion": "eu-west-1",
    ...
    "requestParameters": {
        "functionName": "test-function",
        ...
    },
    "responseElements": {
        "functionName": "test-function",
        ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

The `InputPathsMap` in the example, will extract only the `awsRegion`, `eventName`, and `functionName` from the API request and response.

- `InputTemplate` key in `InputTransformer`, defines a template of the final input to the target queue, as the exporter's Lambda [expects](#input-structure-for-a-single-event) it. The template is rendered using the values from the `InputPathsMap`:

```yaml showLineNumbers
Properties:
  ...
  Targets:
    - Id: "PortAWSExporterEventsQueue"
      Arn: { "Fn::ImportValue" : {"Fn::Sub": "${PortAWSExporterStackName}-EventsQueueARN" } }
      InputTransformer:
        InputPathsMap:
          awsRegion: $.detail.awsRegion
          eventName: $.detail.eventName
          requestFunctionName: $.detail.requestParameters.functionName
          responseFunctionName: $.detail.responseElements.functionName
        # highlight-start
        InputTemplate: |-
          {
            "resource_type": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
            "requestFunctionName": "<requestFunctionName>",
            "responseFunctionName": "<responseFunctionName>",
            "eventName": "<eventName>",
            "region": "\"<awsRegion>\"",
            "identifier": "if .responseFunctionName != \"\" then .responseFunctionName else .requestFunctionName end",
            "action": "if .eventName | startswith(\"Delete\") then \"delete\" else \"upsert\" end"
          }
        # highlight-end
```

Here, the `InputTemplate` takes the information extracted in the `InputPathsMap`, and constructs a message that will be sent to the SQS queue, and will be consumed by the Exporterâ€™s Lambda.
The message includes the hardcoded resource type (`AWS::Lambda::Function`); the `awsRegion` from the event;
a JQ query to figure out the action (`upsert` or `delete` the Port entity), based on the `eventName`; and a JQ query to calculate the AWS Cloud Control resource identifier, based on the function name from the API response or request.

## Setup summary

1. You should prepare an [event rule](#event-rule-definition), based on any specific events;

2. Create the event rule from step 1.

   :::tip Create a rule
   You can create and deploy an event rule, using a Cloudformation YAML template (`template.yml`), like in the [example](#definition), using this command:

   ```bash showLineNumbers
   aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yml --stack-name port-aws-exporter-event-rules
   ```
